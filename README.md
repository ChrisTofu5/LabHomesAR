# Lab Homes AR
The Lab Homes AR repository contains the source code for an augmented reality application that was created to enhance tours of the PNNL Lab Homes. The application was created using Unity and ARCore and is compatible with Android phones that support Google ARCore. Upon detection of specific posters within the Lab Homes, the application plays informative audio clips and displays detailed 3D models and animations that make tours of the Lab Homes more engaging. Several of these 3D models and animations are interactive and change dynamically as the user interacts with them.
